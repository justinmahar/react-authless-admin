<h1>NonAdminOnly</h1>

## Description

A component wrapper that shows children to non-admins unless switched off site-wide by [useAdmin](/useAdmin).

This is for static sites that want to show components for non-admins (and hide for admins) but do not have user authentication.

Anything wrapped in `NonAdminOnly` will be hidden when admin is switched on.

See [AdminOnly](/AdminOnly) to hide components when admin is switched off.

## Usage

The following will appear empty if admin is enabled. Try disabling it via the [demo](/demo).

<Playground>
  <NonAdminOnly>
    <div style={{ border: 'solid 1px lightgray', padding: "10px", marginTop: "10px" }}>
      <strong>This content is only visible when admin is disabled.</strong>
    </div>
  </NonAdminOnly>
</Playground>
