<h1>AdminOnly</h1>

## Description

A component wrapper that hides children unless switched on site-wide by [useAdmin](/useAdmin).

This is for static sites that want to show components to admins ([nonsensitive only](#security-note)) but do not have user authentication to determine who is an admin or not.

Anything wrapped in `AdminOnly` will be hidden unless admin is switched on.

Things you hide should be:
- Useless to general users, even if they had access to it (which they do)
- Convenient for admins, such as direct links to edit content or other admin tools requiring a login

> The content hidden should be useless to general users and convenient for admins.

See [NonAdminOnly](/NonAdminOnly) to hide components when admin is switched on.

## Usage

```jsx
import { AdminOnly } from 'react-authless-admin';
```

The following will appear empty if admin is disabled. Try enabling it via the [demo](/demo).

<Playground>
  <AdminOnly>
    <div style={{ border: 'solid 1px lightgray', padding: "10px", marginTop: "10px" }}>
      <strong>This content is only visible when admin is enabled.</strong>
    </div>
  </AdminOnly>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={AdminOnly} />

> Note: Expand each prop for more information.

## Security Note

**Do not put anything sensitive inside an AdminOnly wrapper!** Since this is all done client-side, a savvy enough user has access to everything you put inside.

You should only use this to hide things like links to pages elsewhere that require authentication. Examples include private repos, [Netlify CMS](/NetlifyCMSButton) admin pages, Google Analytics, deploys, or useful information that would be harmless for the general public to know.

For example, an Edit Content button at the end of a blog post that takes someone directly to the authenticated edit page in Netlify CMS is very convenient for Netlify CMS admins but useless for everyone else.

## Example

See the [demo](/demo) for a full example.
