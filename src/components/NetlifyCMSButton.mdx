<h1>NetlifyCMSButton</h1>

## Description

A button that takes you to a specific entry or collection in [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/).

The button should be given the `collection` name and `entry` name for the Netlify CMS admin page you'd like the button to visit. You can also give it an `href` to manually specify the destination.

Place the button inside an [AdminOnly](/AdminOnly) and use the [useAdmin hook](/useAdmin) to make it visible for admins.

## Usage

```jsx
import { NetlifyCMSButton } from 'react-authless-admin';
```

<Playground>
  <NetlifyCMSButton collection="posts" entry="hello-world"  adminRootPath="/react-authless-admin/admin" openInNewWindow>✏️ Edit Content</NetlifyCMSButton>
</Playground>
