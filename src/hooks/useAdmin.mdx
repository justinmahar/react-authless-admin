<h1>useAdmin</h1>

## Description

This hook can be used to enable or disable admin-only components on a static site that lacks user authentication.

Using this, components such as an edit content button (that takes you to an admin page elsewhere) can be hidden from all non-admin users.

This is accomplished via a [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) value. This means switching admin on will persist between browser sessions unless the user clears their history.

## Usage

```jsx
const [isAdmin, setIsAdmin] = useAdmin();
```

Then, to toggle the admin state:

```jsx
setIsAdmin(!isAdmin);
```

This will set the value in local storage and synchronize all existing hooks.

### Using A Passcode

One way to use this hook is to create a passcode for admins and call `setIsAdmin(true)` when entered on an admin login page.

See the [demo](/demo) for an example of this.

### Role Support

You can pass the hook the key name to use in [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).

For example:

```jsx
const [isEditor, setIsEditor] = useAdmin('editor');
const [isDesigner, setIsDesigner] = useAdmin('designer');
```

This allows you to support multiple roles if needed. Those keys can then be provided to [AdminOnly](/AdminOnly) and [NonAdminOnly](/NonAdminOnly) via the `localStorageKeyName` prop.

## Signature

`useAdmin(localStorageKeyName?: string) => [boolean, (isAdmin: boolean) => void]`

### Props

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| localStorageKeyName | `string` | Optional. The [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) key name for the admin boolean. Defaults to `react-authless-admin` |

### Return

The hook returns an array containing:

| Index | Name | Type | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| 0 | isAdmin | `boolean` | `true` if admin is enabled, `false` otherwise. |
| 1 | setIsAdmin | `(isAdmin: boolean) ⇒ void` | Setter that sets admin to enabled or disabled. Persists to local storage and synchronizes all hooks. |
