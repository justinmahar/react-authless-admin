## Overview

This project features a simple, local-storage-based means of hiding nonsensitive admin-only content from non-admins on sites that lack user authentication.

Some examples include Edit Content links at the end of posts, links to analytics, and links to other useful admin-only pages.

Just wrap your admin-only content in an [AdminOnly](/AdminOnly) tag and reveal it with [useAdmin](/useAdmin).

### Features include:

- **🎛️ Add admin-only controls to your authless site**
  - Make life easier for admins without adding useless clutter for non-admins.
- **🌞 Simplest solution**
  - Hide nonsensitive admin content without the overkill of external auth dependency.
- **🌐 Site-wide and persistent between sessions**
  - One setting to affect the whole site. Uses local storage for persistence.
- **🙈 Cater content to both non-admins and admins**
  - Show and hide content from both types of users, simulating the feel of being logged in.
- **👩‍🎨 Admin role support**
  - Show or hide content for different admin roles using custom local storage key names.
- **📝 Netlify CMS button**
  - Using Netlify CMS? A button is included to make linking to collections and entries easy.

## Why use this?

Imagine you have a piece of content on a static [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) blog that has no user login system. You author the content yourself, maybe with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), in markdown and trigger a build and deploy on every publish.

As an admin, when viewing your site you want to be able to easily edit this content without having to search for it manually either in GitHub or Netlify CMS. A server-based CMS like WordPress would show you an Edit Content button, but since our site has no concept of user auth, it has no idea you're an admin.

You could integrate with an external auth system, but there's a much simpler way.

With `react-authless-admin`, you can wrap your admin-only links in [AdminOnly](/AdminOnly) and they will show up site-wide when toggled by [useAdmin](/useAdmin). Similarly, you can wrap any content for non-admin users inside [NonAdminOnly](/NonAdminOnly).

This allows you to easily control content that's useless to general users, but useful if you're an admin, without needing an auth integration. Check out the [demo](/demo) for an example.

## Installation

```
npm i react-authless-admin
```

## Quick Start

- Hide content from non-admins with [AdminOnly](/AdminOnly).
- Hide content from admins with [NonAdminOnly](/NonAdminOnly).
- Use the [useAdmin hook](/useAdmin) to switch admin on and off.

```jsx
import { AdminOnly, NonAdminOnly, useAdmin } from 'react-authless-admin';
```

```jsx
const [isAdmin, setIsAdmin] = useAdmin();
```

```jsx
<button onClick={() => setIsAdmin(!isAdmin)}>{ isAdmin ? 'Switch Off' : 'Switch On' }</button>
<AdminOnly>
  This content is only visible when admin is enabled.
</AdminOnly>
<NonAdminOnly>
  This content is only visible when admin is disabled.
</NonAdminOnly>
```

See the [demo](/demo) for an example of using a passcode to reveal admin-only components to manage a post.
